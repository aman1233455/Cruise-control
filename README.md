# Cruise-control
# Remote Control Car with Cruise Control, Braking, and Collision Detection üöó

## Project Overview üåü
This project involves building a remote control car with advanced features like speed control, automated cruise control, braking, and collision detection. The car is controlled via Bluetooth (ESP32), and the system leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to adjust its behavior based on the environment.

### Key Features üöÄ
- **Remote Control via Bluetooth (ESP32)**: Control the car's speed, direction, and other functionalities using a Bluetooth-enabled remote.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**: Control the motor speed and direction precisely.
- **Automated Cruise Control**: AI-driven cruise control that adjusts speed based on road conditions.
- **Collision Detection**: Uses sensors to detect obstacles and applies braking when needed.
- **Braking System**: AI-based braking system that adapts based on current speed and environmental conditions.
  
### Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Microcontroller**: STM32 series microcontroller (e.g., STM32F4 or STM32H7)
- **Bluetooth**: ESP32 module for Bluetooth communication
- **PWM**: Pulse Width Modulation for motor control
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Using Python libraries such as TensorFlow Lite, STMCube.AI, CMSIS NN, Kalman Filter, and Fuzzy Logic for decision-making and sensor data processing
- **Communication Protocols**: SPI, UART, CAN for communication between devices
- **Sensors**: Ultrasonic sensors (or similar) for collision detection

## System Architecture üìä

The system architecture for this project involves multiple components working together:
1. **STM32 MCU**:
   - Controls the motors and PWM.
   - Communicates with the ESP32 via UART (or SPI).
   - Processes sensor data to detect obstacles and implement AI-driven features.
   
2. **ESP32**:
   - Provides Bluetooth communication to control the car remotely.

3. **Sensors**:
   - Ultrasonic/IR sensors detect obstacles and help in collision detection.

4. **AI Models**:
   - The system uses TensorFlow Lite models, Kalman Filter, and Fuzzy Logic to automate features like cruise control and braking.
